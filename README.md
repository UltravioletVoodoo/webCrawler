# webCrawler
simple webcrawler made in python. My Elec prof had a website that was plain text, and annoying to look through for assignment due dates. This ultra-basic webcrawler made it just a single click because i'm lazy.

## Dependencies

    - Python 2.7

## Installation Instructions

    ```
    pip install BeautifulSoup
    ```

    ```
    python WebCrawler1.0.py
    ```
